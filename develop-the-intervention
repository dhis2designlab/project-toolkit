# Develop the intervention


**Output:** Implementable intervention (increment?)

**Aim**
To develop an implementable intervention (increment) through iterations of prototyping and testing with stakeholders

**Key elements**
An iterative process of:
 - Prototyping 
 - Testing with stakeholders

### Prototyping and testing with stakeholders
When prototyping during the development phase, it is important to be aware of what is being prototyped. What to prototype depends on what you want to receive feedback on. Some prototypes may elicit feedback on the page layout in an app, while another may act as a starting point for a discussion for team members or stakeholders by illustrating an idea or exploring a concept.

Prototypes vary in sophistication, from simple paper sketches of an envisioned ‘solution’ or scenario, to more fleshed out prototypes focusing on end-user interaction. Paper sketches can be used to visualize and explore ideas without investing too many resources before presenting them to team members or stakeholders to discuss or receive feedback. Acting out scenarios around new work arrangements such as meetings, roles and tasks can be a way of prototyping organizational changes.

The overall goal of every prototype should be to increase the team’s understanding of the users, use context and organizational conditions. Following iterations in the development phase should use the relevant insights gained from prototype discussions and feedback when they are being worked on.
