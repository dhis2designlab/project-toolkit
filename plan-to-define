# Plan to Define  

**Output:** Open Plan/project canvas
-   Preliminary problem statement
-   Preliminary access
-   Preliminary stakeholders 

**Aim**
To develop an open-ended and initial project plan for the activities carried out in the exploratory design of the intervention concept.

**Key elements**
-   Setting the course for the project
-   What should be achieved on a high level? (organizational goal)
-   Establishing a rough timeline
-   Defining boundaries in terms of project scope, mandate and absolute boundaries
-   Initial budget for defining an intervention concept
-   Agreement on initial access needs (people, facilities, documents)
-   Defining who will be in the ‘design team’ (at least 1- 2 people from both client and consultant)

### Project configuration
Project configuration refers to the scope, mandate, objectives, and structure of the design and innovation project. The activity of configuring the project should be revisited continuously throughout the design process as the problem is better understood and formulated and as a solution gradually materializes. Initially, the project configuration can be guided by an initial and preliminary problem area of focus such as improving the usability of a data entry screen, or better supporting the use of routine data by a user group. Based on this, the initial scope, mandate, process and structure, and stakeholders are defined. As a better understanding of the problem and potential solutions develop these may be renegotiated and reformulated.

### Defining the projects objectives and values
Any IT or organizational change project is driven by some more or less explicit objectives and values. It is useful to explicitly reflect, discuss, and define these (and frequently revisit them as part of reconfiguring the project) as different objectives and values will have significant implications for the design and innovation process and its outcomes.

  *Primary objectives*
First and foremost, the primary objectives of the project should be defined, which should capture the main intended outcome of the project. For instance, a primary objective could be to increase the use of data in decision making, to improve data quality, strengthen the working conditions of a group of workers, or to strengthen the usability of a data entry tool.

*Secondary objectives and values*
Projects often also involve a variety of changes beyond the primary objectives that affect various stakeholders. Secondary objectives can be designed related to other positive outcomes one seeks to achieve or commits to through the project. For instance, a project can be based on participatory values to ensure a democratic design process, or that the project should commit to humanistic values that promote the welfare of workers.
 
  
  
### Problem formulation
Problem formulation is about defining the problem to be addressed in the design and innovation project. Many design and innovation projects suffer from being guided by a superficial or implicit understanding of the problem to be solved, and the lack of a critical examination of what represents the right problem to solve. This may result in building solutions or interventions that are irrelevant or the missing out of opportunities for innovations that results in more valuable improvements to the organization. Accordingly, problem formulation should be an explicit activity which is revisited several times based on the developing appreciation of the problem situation.

In a project, one should thus iterate between problem formulation and developing an understanding of the socio-technical system to ensure to develop a sufficiently detailed understanding of the “right” problem to be addressed before moving to identify potential solutions. The larger, more multifaceted, more complex, and vaguely defined the problem is, the more iterations would be required before moving towards exploring and identifying possible solutions. A reformulating of the problem may also require iterations back to the project configuration to redefine the design scope and mandate of the project.

**Secure early and continuous stakeholder involvement and commitment**
Problems are always formulated from a perspective, and what is considered to be a problem by one stakeholder may not be so by another. To secure commitment from key stakeholders, these should accordingly be involved in the problem formulation activities to make sure that everyone agrees that the problem is relevant to be addressed, and as a consequence, are committed to exploring and potentially implementing relevant solutions
