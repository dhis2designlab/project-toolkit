# Evaluate

**Output:** Document learnings about the use of the intervention in context
    
**Aim**
To evaluate the effects of the intervention towards the objectives and measurable desired outcomes

**Key elements**
 - Qualitative evaluation 
 - Quantitative evaluation 

The goal here is to meet the requirements and needs, and to understand to what extent the intervention leads to organizational improvement. This could be done through evaluating short- and long term perspective of the intervention operating within an organization, utilizing techniques such as:
-   Interview
-   Observation
-   If relevant: DHO/data use workshops

### Evaluation
Evaluation is about subjecting prototypes to feedback and testing with relevant stakeholders such as project managers and end users. The findings from the evaluation feeds into new cycles of ideation and prototyping, or, eventually, to establishing that the design is satisfactory for implementation. Evaluation may hence result in findings that show that the prototyped dimension is the wrong way to go, that it needs refinement on certain aspects, or that it is satisfactory.

Evaluation is tightly integrated with prototyping as one selects the form of prototyping based on the dimensions of a solution one wants to evaluate. This means that the form of evaluation should be decided in tandem with deciding what dimensions to prototype and how to prototype them.

Different types of dimensions and prototypes invite different types of evaluations. Low-fidelity prototypes often invite for and require more open-ended forms of evaluations such as discussions, demonstrations, and walkthroughs. High fidelity prototypes, which, for instance, can be used to evaluate usability, invite for more realistic evaluations where the user actually uses a user interface or an app.

### Interview and observation
Plan for interview and observation by choosing where this should take place, what questions to ask, what to look for etc.
- Interview guide/plan
- What kind of questions should you ask
- What are you looking for 

### How to interpret/analyse the findings

### What now? 
**If the solution is found to respond well to the identified needs and requirements** 
Should be maintained, evaluate scalability etc. 

**If intervention is not good fit for the identified problem area**
Consider starting the project anew, using the learnings and new and emerging problems when conducting new iterations.
